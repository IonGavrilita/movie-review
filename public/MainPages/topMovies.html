                    <h1>  #1 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h1>
                    <h2>Director: Frank Darabont, Movie rate: 9.3 </h2>
                    <p>It's no surprise that the highest ranked film of all time is also one of the most crowd-pleasing films of all time. You would think that a story set inside a maximum security prison would not have many pleasing moments, but The Shawshank Redemption manages to be a surprisingly uplifting tale.</p>

                    <h1>  #2 The Godfather (1972) </h1>
                    <h2> Director: Francis Ford Coppola,  Movie rate:9.2</h2>
                    <p>The Godfather: Part II is one of the most acclaimed films of all time and still it's not the highest ranked film in that trilogy. That honor goes to the original. There's a lot of debate among film fans about which is the better movie, but it's safe to say they are both massive achievements in cinema.</p>

                    <h2>Director: Francis Ford Coppola,  Movie rate:9.0</h2>
                    <p>Of course, the most famous example of this is The Godfather: Part II. It probably seemed like a preposterous idea at the time for Francis Ford Coppola to make a follow-up to his widely acclaimed crime saga, but he proved it was a very good idea.</p>

                    <h1> #4 The Dark Knight (2008)</h1>
                    <h2>Director: Christopher Nolan, Movie rate: 9.0</h2>
                    <p>The superhero genre might not get a lot of respect from most cinephiles, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman film proved they can deliver smart, epic and thrilling movies.</p><p>The film details Batman's desperate attempt to stop Joker from destroying Gotham as he searches for someone to take up the role of the city's protector. The film feels like a crime epic, with some amazing set pieces and unpredictable twists. However, the film is most remembered for the late Heath Leger's mesmerizing performance as the anarchist Joker.

                    <h1> #5 12 Angry Men (1957)</h1>
                    <h2>Dircetor: Sidney Lumet, Movie rate: 8.9</h2>
                    <p>While most of the films on this list are giant epics, 12 Angry Men is, by comparison, much smaller. However, that does nothing to lessen its impact. The film is set almost entirely inside a jurors room as the twelve men debate a murder case they have just overseen. With one voice insisting the accused is innocent, the film details the life-or-death debate which ensues.</p>
